            <p align="justify">Please note that we will require proof of identity before releasing any information.</p>
            <p align="justify">We are also obliged to contact users periodically to confirm that KYC is up-to-date and accurate, and reserve the right to do so as a part of normal operations. Users are expected to provide accurate and truthful information and to update us of relevant changes.</p>
            <p align="justify">Users are encouraged to update and amend their volunteered information through the functionalities built into the Seedbox Philippines platforms.</p>
            <p align="justify">Users who choose to close their accounts with Seedbox Philippines are assumed to no longer wish to use the service. However, the laws of the Republic of the Philippines require that we maintain information relevant to financial transactions for up to five years after their settlement dates. We therefore cannot delete user information from our platform until after five years have passed. For the sake of convenience, we date this period from when the user closes their Seedbox Philippines account.</p>
            <p align="justify">Also, closing accounts with Seedbox Philippines does not automatically trigger redemption or account closure with relevant fund providers, wallet providers and other third parties. Users must still process redemptions and account closures with these third parties.</p>
            <p align="justify" style={{fontSize: '17px', marginBottom: '7px'}}><b>WAIVER OF DATA PRIVACY</b></p>
            <p align="justify">Because Seedbox Philippines is simply a distribution service, fund providers whose funds are available through the platforms will also require access to this data. Similarly, third party software providers for wallet and other stored value solutions may require access to this data as part of their mandated registration and KYC process. To simplify the process of signing up with these third parties, we ask users for their permission to provide the data they have already volunteered on our platform with the relevant third parties. This consent is never assumed, and is always solicited within the proper context of our operations. However, Seedbox Philippines has no say in how user data is managed, stored or used in third party systems.</p>
            <p align="justify">By signing up and agreeing to the Terms of Use of Seedbox Philippines, you, the user, thereby authorize the transfer, disclosure and communication of any information relating to his/her/their Account, or any information thereon, or any of his investments with ATR Asset Management, Inc. to any of the offices, branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, parent, agents and representatives, for use in connection with the provision of any service or product relating to your accounts or investments and for data processing and storage, customer satisfaction surveys, anti-money laundering monitoring, review and reporting, statistical, credit√Ç&nbsp; and risk analysis and risk management purposes. In addition to the foregoing, ATR Asset Management, Inc,. and any branch, subsidiary, affiliate, parent, agent, representative or third party may transfer and disclose any such information as may be required by any law or regulation.</p>
